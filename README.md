This project is a sports nutrition supplements e-commerce web application. The main goal is to allow users to register a profile and purchase the products avaiable.
The business/store owner can access, archive, edit or add products to the database through the Admin interface.

### Design

-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The colours used in this project are black and yellow(#C0B01F). After a lot of research I have come to realize that the combination of yellow and black is often used in sports nutrition supplements web applications. 

-   #### Typography
    -   The font-family "Black Ops One" is the one used for the logo, navigation bar, page titles and buttons. This font has a very powerful look and since the web application is gym/health related it felt like the right one to use. For the website content the font-family used is "Assistant", smooth, clean and easy to read. Sans Serif is the fallback font used in case 'Black Ops One' and/or "Assistant" are not being imported into the project correctly.

-   #### Imagery
    -   All the images are sports nutrition supplements related. If there is no image file/url  associated to the product a default image will be displayed instead.
